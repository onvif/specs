    <section>
      <title>Connection Establishment</title>
      <para>There are two connection mechanisms available for a device to connect to a remote client. The device can either use an http/2 reverse tunnel or a WebSocket.</para>
      <section>
        <title>Establishing the reverse tunnel</title>
        <para>
          The device initiates the connection to the cloud service. This is done in three phases.
          Phase 2 and 3 depend on the protocol being used and are detailed below.
          In the first phase the device acts as TLS client that connects to the cloud service.
          Details of the TCP and TLS exchange are out of scope of this specification.
        </para>
        <section>
          <title>Native h2c-reverse</title>
          <para> <!-- HTTP/2 normal -->
            The second phase includes the connection upgrade to HTTP/2 h2c-reverse protocol which is confirmed by the cloud service with a 101 HTTP response.
            The third phase of the connection then fully complies to an HTTP2 connection as if it were initiated from the cloud service.
            Please note that the figure only shows the most relevant packets.
          </para>
          <figure xml:id="_Ref505091745">

          </figure>
          <para>This protocol shall be used when the uri protocol states 'https'. A device signaling
            support for https via its Protocol capability shall support native h2c-reverse.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>WebSocket h2c-reverse</title>
          <para>
            <!-- WebSocket normal --> The second phase includes the connection upgrade to a
            WebSocket with the reverse HTTP2 subprotocol which is confirmed by the cloud service
            with a 101 HTTP response. The third phase of the connection then corresponds to an HTTP2
            connection as if it were initiated from the cloud services, using WebSocket binary
            frames. Please note that the figure only shows the most relevant packets. You may
            provide an access token by adding a query parameter to the WebSocket URI as defined by
            [RFC6750] Section 2.3. </para>
          <figure xml:id="_Ref484594140">

          <para>This protocol shall be used when the uri protocol states 'wss'. A device signaling
            support for wss via its Protocol capability shall support h2c-reverse over
            WebSocket.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>HTTP/2 Frames</title>
          <para>Once an http/2 connection has been established the communication parameters are negotiated as specified by RFC 7540 so that the uplink can be used to exchange frames between the remote client and the local service.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>HTTP Transactions</title>
          <para>The uplink shall be used in reverse direction for http requests and responses. The remote client shall send requests that are served in a standard http manner by the local service.</para>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Connection Management</title>
      <para>A local service that is offered to a remote client for utilization is responsible for maintaining an operational communication channel. Since the connection needs to be established from the service to the remote client this connection is called uplink. The uplink shall be secured via TLS. </para>
      <para>The local service shall monitor whether the remote client is able to communicate via the
        uplink. It may use the HTTP/2 ping mechanism to check whether a link is still operational if
        no packets have been received for a longer period of time.</para>
      <para>The local service shall close and reconnect the uplink whenever no packets have been
        received from the remote client for more than 30 seconds. Each camera shall use an
        individual ascending interval strategy to avoid that all cameras connect at the same
        time.</para>
      <para>The following example shows patterns chosen by two cameras A and B:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Camera A: 3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, 30s, 30s, 30s ...</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Camera B: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s, 30s, 30s ...</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>If multiple uplink configurations are included, the device shall try to establish 
        all connections from the list and maintain those connections in parallel.</para>
      <para>Note that this specification expects different clients may try to reach multiple local
        services and it is assumed services and clients are designed such that they do not interfere
        with each other. The coordination between such multiple clients and services is outside of
        the scope of the specification.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Authentication</title>
      <para>Note that for the following discussion the roles of client and server are swapped.</para>
      <para>The remote client shall authenticate itself using a valid server certificate. The local
        service shall verify the validity of the remote certificate according to RFC 6125.</para>
      <section>
        <title>mTLS authentication</title>
        <para>When using mTLS authentication, the local service shall authenticate itself at the
          remote client using TLS client authentication according to RFC 5246 or subsequent
          specifications.</para>
        <para>To uniquely identify a local service on remote client, it is recommended to have a unique client certificate installed on each local service. For example, CN field or Serial number of installed certificate could be used to uniquely identify the local service.</para>
        <para>The device shall assign any tunneled HTTP or RTSP request the UserLevel that is configured for the configuration without the need of further authentication request headers. </para>
        <para>If the <literal>CertificateID</literal> is present in the <literal>UplinkConfiguration</literal> the device shall use this authentication mechanism.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>JWT authentication</title>
        <para>When using JWT authentication, the local service shall provide a JWT token when sending the upgrade request.</para>
        <para>The remote client shall validate the JWT token provided following the JWT specification as defined in the Core specification.</para>
        <para>The device shall assign any tunneled HTTP or RTSP request the UserLevel that is configured for the configuration without the need of further authentication request headers.</para>
        <para>When a device indicates JsonWebToken is supported through its Capabilities, then it shall support JWT authentication in this specification.</para>
        <para>If the <literal>AuthorizationServer</literal> token is present in the <literal>UplinkConfiguration</literal> the device shall use this authentication mechanism.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Media Streaming</title>
      <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>The ONVIF Media Service Specification and the ONVIF Streaming Specification define
          various mechanism for streaming Video, Audio and Metadata. This specification defines how
          to apply streaming over http/2. Usage of other communication mechanism like UDP unicast
          and multicast are outside of the scope of this specification.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>RTSP over HTTP</title>
        <para>The underlying RTSP over HTTP specification requires to open separate communication
          channels for continously sending and receiving data. For sending media from RTSP server to
          client the communication channel is opened with a GET request and a response without
          content-length. For sending media to the server a POST request is used. The specification
          notes that a content-length must be sent. Most applications use the value 32767 from the
          example given in the specification. Since http/2 streams may be closed by either side when
          the content-length has been reached clients shall use a value large enough for the
          connection life time.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>RTSP over WebSockets</title>
        <para>A device signaling support for websockets over RTSP via its capability
          RTSPWebSocketUri shall support RFC 8441 on the uplink.</para>
