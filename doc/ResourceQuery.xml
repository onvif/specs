    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>This document describes how a Video Management System can expose its resources so that a remote VSS or a client can make use of them with the APIs defined by the various ONVIF specifications.</para>
    <para>The example in <xref linkend="_Ref486253450" /> shows two cameras attached to a lower level VSS which are operated from a client that connects to an upper level VSS. This document assumes that standard existing ONVIF commands are used for e.g. moving the focus in the example below.</para>
    <para>This specification focuses on resource naming and querying. </para>

      <title>Resource Addressing</title>
      <para>In the ONVIF specifications resources are addressed by so called tokens. Tokens are character strings of a defined length and are enumerated by the device to ease the devices resource management. Similarly this specifications assumes that a VSS enumerates its attached device resources in such a way that a unique token is assigned to each of its attached devices resources.</para>
      <para>Additionally this specification assumes that a VSS implements resource token mapping by adding a prefix delimited by a colon. Whether a VSS simply prepends a prefix to a device token or does a complete remapping is outside of the scope of this specification.</para>
      <para>The following list provides an incomplete list of resources that can be handled:</para>

    <section>
      <title>Resource Queries and Updates</title>
      <para>This specification uses the ONVIF property event mechanism to model global resources. A client or upper level VSS subscribes to a VSS pull point. In consecutive requests it then pulls all resources it is interested in in order to get to know all relevant resources of a lower level VSS. </para>
      <para>Once all resources have been reported further pull messages will either timeout when no changes happened or report changes. In this context changes are added resources, modification of resource properties or removed resources.</para>
      <para>By applying the property event notification mechanism to resources a client or upper level VSS has always up to date information about the lower level VSS resources it is interested in.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Events</title>
      <para>An upper level VSS can retrieve events either generic or for a given token. In order to retrieve e.g. motion events from a dedicated resource a client has to provide a content filter with matching source token.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Authentication</title>
      <para>Access to remote VSS may require strict authentication constraints. Refer to the ONVIF Security Configuration Specification for means to server and client authentication.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Live Checks</title>
      <para>The mechanism defined in this specification make use of the ONVIF real-time pull point. When no events are pending at a pull point the PullMessages call will timeout after a client defined timeout. The client is in control of the timeout and can so ensure a continuous heartbeat from the server. Hence an additional ping or heartbeat interface is not needed.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Live Video Example</title>
      <para>This example assumes that a police station client wants to get live feeds related to an incident at a certain geo location.</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The client authenticates itself at the VSS using its client certificate.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Client subscribes to VSS topic Resource/MediaProfile in a distance of 100 meter of a lon/lat provided geo location.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>VSS responds to PullMessages with enumerating all media profiles in the given area.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>If the client receives multiple profiles for a remote device it may select the best suited one by querying the profile configurations. For each profile token the client calls GetProfiles. By supplying parameter Type set to VideoSource and VideoEncoder it will receive detailed information about the Video resolution and encoder settings.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The client calls GetStreamUri for each video source on the selected profile</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The client streams video and displays it on the Police Video Wall.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>At the first glance it looks like no new functional interface has been defined. Although this is correct, the VSS still has to implement a number of operations in order to make the above example happen:</para>
      <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
          <para>Enumerate its attached camera profiles as resource events</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Implement the Media2 API</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Map request media profile token to cameras and their local tokens</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Map response profile tokens to global tokens</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Support streaming proxy and map camera stream uri to proxy</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>Additionally an intelligent VSS may expose only those media profiles to its client that have a decent data rate so that it is able to proxy those Video streams.</para>
      <para>Instead of directly connecting to the remote lower level VSS systems the police station client may connect to an upper level VSS that in turn combines search results from multiple lower level VSS and forwards commands to individual camera sources via the appropriate lower level VSS. </para>

      <para>Alternative to the above approach the client might also directly query recording resource at a geo location. Some replays may fail because the cameras did not record for the selected location at the selected time of day.</para>
      <para>Above example is applicable for both content stored in camera's edge storage and VMS recording server. It is up to the VMS application how the recordings are retrieved.</para>

      <title>Notification Mechanism</title>
      <para>This specification assumes that the ONVIF Realtime Pullpoint mechanism is deployed. Note that the resource query is transparent to the event transport mechanism and the events may also be conveyed via the OASIS Base Notification mechanism or the Notification Streaming Interface.</para>

  </chapter>
  <chapter>
    <title>Resource Addressing</title>
    <section>
      <title>Remote Tokens</title>
      <para>ONVIF specifications are generally assuming that the device defines tokens which are unique within a device and its context. This specification extends the scheme to allow building globally unique tokens called remote tokens. </para>
      <para>A remote token shall be constructed like a qname with a device specific prefix and a local token. </para>
      <para>	RemoteToken = Prefix + ':' + LocalToken</para>
      <para>The overall string length of the remote token is limited to 64 characters. A local token must not exceed 36 characters and should contain no colon. The length limitation is chosen such that it enables the use of UUIDs as defined in RFC 4122. Note that device implementations typically use compact tokens composed from few characters.</para>
      <para>A VSS shall use the same prefix for all tokens of the same device. This allows a client to understand which tokens they can use for any ONVIF API call.</para>
      <para>A VSS may choose to simply use device local tokens as LocalToken part or create an internal mapping. A client may not assume that use tokens received from a VSS directly in device calls by stripping the prefix.</para>
      <para>The naming conventions for the prefix part are outside of the scope of this specification. Depending on the application area implementers may choose different approaches. As a consequence this specification does not mandate that remote tokens are globally unique between different VSS. See Annex A for a country specific definition of globally unique addresses.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Token Context</title>
      <para>Clients talking to multiple servers at a time like VSS and/or devices shall address resources to a server only with tokens received from that same server. There is no guarantee that remote tokens received from one server may be used to address the same resource at another server.</para>

  </chapter>
  <chapter>
    <title>Resource Queries</title>
    <section>
      <title>General</title>
      <para>This specification models resources as so called property events. A resource is an ONVIF configuration item addressed via a token.  </para>
      <para>A server supporting resource queries shall signal the supported resource queries via the GetEventProperties interface of the event service. The following resources may be enumerated:</para>
      <para>For media configurations:</para>
      <para>VideoSourceConfiguration, AudioSourceConfiguration, VideoEncoderConfiguration, AudioEncoderConfiguration,  AudioOutputConfiguration, AudioDecoderConfiguration, MetadataConfiguration, AnalyticsConfiguration, PTZConfiguration, OSDConfiguration, MaskConfiguration</para>
      <para>For media profiles: MediaProfile</para>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>A lower level VSS can have recordings that are managed in several different ways, for example it might be handled directly by the Lower VSS or it might be stored on a cameras edge storage.</para>
      <para>Regardless of how the lower level VSS actually makes and stores its recordings, it has to model it in a way that are compatible with the ONVIF recording API model.</para>
      <para>The ONVIF recording API allows for two different recording models. Either the recording is modeled as an edge recording done on a camera device or it is modeled as a remote recording done on a NVR device: In the edge recording case the recording source is a local ONVIF media profile and in the NVR case the recording source is an ONVIF receiver object containing a RTSP URL.</para>
      <para>Since the ONVIF resource query is based on adding a globally unique device prefix to the device local token the recording model used by the lower level VSS will have an impact on the upper level VSS ability to understand what camera made a recording.</para>

      <title>Lower level VSS recording API model</title>
      <para>In the forensic example in section <xref linkend="_Ref25752452" /> the upper level VSS does a resource query for recording token within a specific geographical area. If the lower level VSS would have chosen to represent its recording according to the NVR style, it should be no problem for the upper VSS to locate the interesting recordings and actually watch them. But it would create a problem for the upper VSS if it actually would like to know what edge device made the recording. The problem mainly being how to map the RTSP URL in the receiver object to the global token prefix it knows.</para>
      <para>Furthermore if the upper level VSS instead of using a location filter would like to use a prefix filter, see section <xref linkend="_Ref25752483" />, the NVR style recording model creates huge problem since there are no easy way to ask for recordings belonging to a specific camera device prefix.</para>
      <para>The lower level VSS should when adopting recording specific tokens make sure that for the upper level VSS it looks like all recording is made using the ONVIF edge storage style of recoding. For an example of this see</para>
