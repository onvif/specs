    <title>Scope</title>
    <para>This specification defines how media from ONVIF devices is signed to give a guarantee that
      the media has not been manipulated since it was transmitted from the device. This
      specification further defines how an ONVIF client should act at file export to preserve the
      signing feature, and also how an ONVIF client should validate the authenticity of a signed
      stream. Audio is outside of scope.</para>

    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>Media Signing is the process of adding cryptographic signatures to captured media as part
      of the codec format. By adding these signatures, the media can be protected against
      manipulation (tampering) and the authenticity can be validated.</para>
    <para>The public key, that is used to verify the signatures, is also included in the media, as
      well as certificates to verify the public key. The CA certificate necessary to verify the
      certificates is not included and has to be acquired from an external trusted source.</para>
  </chapter>
  <chapter xml:id="chapter_f3s_njq_bwb">
    <title>Signed Video</title>
    <para>A video consists of picture frames displayed at a certain frame rate. If these frames are
      transmitted or stored for later use and displayed by a third party it is valuable if it is
      possible to validate that the video has not been manipulated since the time of signing.</para>
    <para>In brief, the principle of signing documents is used, that is, collect information and
      sign the information using a Private signing key. Then, packetize the produced signature
      together with the collected information. For complete validation, the user first verifies the
      certificates with a corresponding CA certificate, followed by Public key verification with
      the certificate, and finally verifies the signature using the Public key. If successful
      so far, the transmitted information can then be used to validate the video segment.</para>
    <para>On a high level, <emphasis>Signed Video</emphasis> hashes encoded video frames and on a
      regular basis creates a <code>document</code> representing these hashes together with some
      additional metadata and signs that <code>document</code>. This signature, together with the
        <code>document</code>, is added to the video using Supplementary Enhancement Information
      (SEI) frames.</para>

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Codecs</emphasis>. <emphasis>Signed Video</emphasis> is defined
        for the H.264 and H.265 video codec formats, for full details see references. 
        Therefore, most of the description uses the Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) concept. 
        For simplicity, hashing is done on NAL Units
        instead of full frame data. One frame may be split into multiple NAL Units and therefore
        generating multiple hashes per frame. Note that raw video is not covered, since there are
        no means to add signatures within the video format. There exists other codec standards
        where the same technique can be applied though, e.g., AV1.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Signing frequency</emphasis>. Signing is done upon transition
        between two Group of Pictures (GOPs), that is, triggered by an IDR frame. For short GOP
        lengths, the time between two GOP transitions may be shorter than the time it takes to
        perform the signing. The standard allows the device to sign multiple GOPs if necessary.
        This is described in Section LINK TO CORRESPONDING SECTION BELOW.
        For very long, or infinite, GOPs the duration between signatures can be too long for
        practical usage. Therefore, the device is recommended to sign partial GOPs; See Section
        TO BE ADDED.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Frame drops and packet losses</emphasis>. Adding a list of
        hashes of each NAL Unit combats the problem of lost frames, but cannot solve packet
        losses unless the affected NAL Unit is completely removed from the stream. To lower the
        risk of losing packets within a SEI frame, the specification allows the device to add
        redundancy by transmitting the same SEI multiple times; See Section "section_y3s_njq_bwb"
        below.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Hashing algorithms</emphasis>. Hashing algorithms, for example
        those specififed in RFC 6234 in references, are generally used to compute a a fixed length
        hash value from any arbitrary long input string. Hashing is used in two contexts; 1)
        to get a short representation of each NAL Unit to put in a list, and 2) as message digest
        when generating signatures. Note that these two can be different. The same hashing
        algorithms have to be used in both the device and the client. The device specifies which
        hashing algorithms were used, which for example limits the ability for the client to put
        extra security on some videos.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Signing algorithm</emphasis>. The standard specifies signing
        algorithm through its OID as definied by the relevant authority or searchable in the global
        OID reference database. Signing should be done in a trusted environment and there are
        usually limitations to which signing algorithms are supported. This limits the scope, and
        the device decides which to use.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Bitrate increase</emphasis>. Adding SEI frames to the encoded
        video increases the bitrate. The list of NAL Unit hashes is the main contribution.
        Therefore, it is recommended to consider a hashing algorithm that produces reasonably large
        hashes. Note that the main security lies in the hash used to generate the signature and not
        the hash used to represent the NAL Unit. The device has an option to select a GOP level
        mode, to lower the bitrate; See Section TO BE ADDED.</para>

      <title>Detailed description on how the device generates SEI frames including
        signatures</title>
      <para>The H.264 and H.265 codec formats, as specified in referenced documents, allows the user
        to add arbitrary data to a stream through SEI frames of type user data unregistered. 
        <emphasis>Signed Video</emphasis> puts the produced signatures and additional metadata in such frames. 
        These SEI frames are ignored by the decoder and will therefore not affect the video rendering. 
        One obvious drawback is that it is easy to change the video from signed to unsigned by dropping
        these SEI frames. In some cases this can also be beneficial. For example, if the user is no 
        longer interested in its authenticity, the SEI frames can be removed and thereby reducing the bitrate. 
        It is out of scope to protect against lost SEI frames. Validating a video where SEIs have been lost or
        removed will anyhow be marked as not authentic, or unsigned (if no SEIs are present).</para>
      <para>All operations are done on the encoded video stream. Each picture frame is split into
        NAL Units and <emphasis role="italic">Signed Video</emphasis> operates on these NAL Units.
        Note that it is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondance between frames and NAL Units. A
        frame split into slices (multiple NAL Units) will generate multiple hashes. In this
        specification, unless explicitly stated, hashing a frame means hashing a NAL Unit.</para>
      <para>All picture NAL Units should be hashed. In addition, all SEI frames, generated by ONVIF
        Media Signing should also be hashed accordingly, unless the SEI includes a signature.</para>
      <para>Some NAL Units have no or limited impact on the visual video and are ignored:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>SPS/PPS/VPS</para>
            <para>The presence of these NAL Units are not consistant. They can for example be sent
              once in the beginning of a stream and stored at client side to add back when exporting
              to file. This is a correct process, but affects the authenticity since Signed Video
              requires the order to be preserved, unless handled separately. There are parts in
              these NAL Units that can change the video behavior, but not to question its
              authenticity.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>AUD</para>
            <para>The Access Unit Delimiter (AUD) is simply a NAL Unit header used in Access Unit
              (AU) video streams, c.f., bytestream. This NAL Unit has no impact on the video and can
              safely be ignored. By ignoring them, the authenticity is preserved when converting
              between AU streams and bytestreams.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>SEIs other than Signed Video specific</para>
            <para>SEI frames are in general information frames that usually has no visible impact on
              the video. Some of them can correctly be added to, or removed from, the stream at any
              time. This makes it difficult to handle from an authenticity point of view. Therefore,
              all SEI frames are ignored.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>Note that these frame types can still affect the visual aspect of a video, but are
        excluded for simplicity. The authenticity of the video is still preserved.</para>

      <title>Signing a GOP</title>
      <para>A GOP is defined as all frames between two IDR frames, including the first IDR. Frames
        between these IDRs are prediction frames and can be either P- or B-frames. Without loss of
        generality, both of these are throughout the text denoted P-frames. Further, for simplicity
        IDRs are referred to as I-frames in this context.</para>
      <para>Each NAL Unit (except those ignored; See above) is hashed in a linked manner. Since
        every P-frame directly or indirectly refers to the I-frame starting the GOP they are linked
        together. If the I-frame is modified it indirectly modifies the P-frames. Therefore, each
        P-frame is hashed together with the dependent I-frame.</para>
      <para>Figure <xref linkend="linkedhashesfig" /> illustrates the linking procedure where a
        frame is encaptured in a single NAL Unit. The hash of the IDR-frame is stored and used to

        Then each frame in a GOP is hashed according to <code>hash(F) = H(h_anch, H(F))</code>,
        where <code>h_anch</code> and <code>H(F)</code> should be hashed as if they were aligned in
        memory. All hashes are collected in a list and together with some metadata forms a
          <code>document</code>, which later will be signed.</para>
      <para>All NAL Unit data, from the NAL Unit header to the last byte, including the stop bit,
        should be hashed. The start code is excluded when hashing.</para>
      <para>If the I-frame is sliced into multiple NAL Uints, the hash of the primary slice should
        be used as <code>h_anch = H(Iprimaryslice)</code>. The other NAL Units of the I-frame are
        hashed in the linked manner described above.</para>
      <para>A hash (<code>gophash</code>) of the list of hashes is added to metadata, <code>gophash
          = H(h_anch, hash(P1), hash(P2), ..., hash(PN))</code>. The <code>gophash</code> simplifies
        validation, since verifying each hash in the list of hashes is only necessary when
        verification of the <code>gophash</code> fails. Another benefit is that the bytestream is
        prepared for the future, where a low-bitrate alternative can be added by omitting the list
        of hashes.</para>
      <para>To preserve the order of GOPs the hash of the I-frame of the previous GOP is also added
        to metadata, that is, <code>hash(Iprevious) = h_anch_previous</code>. For the very first GOP
        a static and pre-defined hash should be used; See the TLV section below.</para>
      <para>This <code>document</code> is then signed to produce a signature as <code>signature =
          sign(H(document))</code> and together with the <code>document</code> itself added to the
        stream in a SEI, that is, SEI = <code>document + signature</code>. The next GOP is initiated
        with a new <code>h_anch</code> using the very same I-frame that triggered the end of current
        GOP.</para>

      <title>Signing partial GOPs</title>
      <para>As mentioned in the Limitation Section above, very long, or even infinite, GOPs puts the
        validation side in an unacceptable situation since the duration between signatures is far to
        long. The device has an option to decide to force signing if the GOP has not ended in a
        reasonable time. It is recommended to split a GOP into partial GOPs if the GOP duration is
        longer than 5 seconds.</para>

        to add a generated SEI to a video stream in a device</title><?oxy_comment_end?>
      <para>Without loss of generality, consider three consecutive GOPs each starting with an
        I-frame followed by 4 non-IDRs (P- or B-frames). In text format it would look like
          <code>IPPPPIPPPPIPPPP</code>. The signing information is collected in a SEI frame
        (<code>S</code>).
        The SEI should be added to the video stream such that it follows the Access Unit (AU)
        format, i.e., it has to prepend all picture NAL Units in an AU. Each I-frame will trigger a
        signing procedure and ideally the SEI is generated and available instantaneously and can
        be attached to the stream as <code>SIPPPPSIPPPPSIPPPP</code>.</para>
      <para>In practice signing in secure hardware takes time and blocking the video stream while
        waiting adds jitter to the video stream. The device therefore has the option to add it to
        the video stream later, when signing has been completed. In such a case the text-ified
        stream can look like <code>IPSPPPISPPPPIPPSPP</code>.</para>
      <para>If the device decides to add redundancy by transmitting the SEI twice the text-ified
        stream would look like <code>IPSSPPPISSPPPPIPPSSPP</code>.</para>

      <title>Certificate validation</title>
      <para>In order to validate the certificate, one follows the certificate chain from the leaf
        certificate to the root certificate according to the x.509 standard. Since Onvif does not
        provide a trusted certificate store the client implementor and/or the end user must install
        trusted root CA certificates in the client. Typically one also need the intermediate CA
        certificate which is also provided by the device. When verifying old video, it may happen
        that the certificates have expired as compared to the current date. However, the
        verification concerns the date that the video was created as such the date should be
        validated against the claimed recording date rather than the current date. </para>

      </title>
      <para>In order to be able to verify an exported segment of Signed Media, the client must
        include the "only sent once" SEI added in the beginning of the mediastream. This can be
        combined with the Onvif Export File Format in order to provide layered video authentication,
        the media signing covers authenticity in the media layer where as the Export File Format
        provides validity on the container level. Even if this Signed Media specification is used,
        the Onvif Export File Format is still valuable as it provides more information of the
        provenance of the video as it allows the user to tell the story of the path of the video.
